A simple, floating lyrics widget for macOS. It detects what you're playing (Spotify, Apple Music, Safari, Chrome, etc.), grabs the lyrics, and displays them as an overlay on your screen.

## Features
- **Auto-detection**: Just play a song. No manual search needed.
- **Draggable & Customizable**: Put the widget anywhere (it remembers its position!), or snap it to a preset screen position (top/center/bottom, left/center/right) from Settings. Tweak fonts, sizes, text/background colors, and layouts from a dedicated Settings window.
- **Karaoke Sync**: Real-time line-by-line lyric tracking with a smooth karaoke-style wipe effect.
- **Auto-Romanization**: Automatically detects non-Latin lyrics (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Cyrillic, etc.) and converts them to Latin script (Romaji, Pinyin, etc.) so you can easily sing along. Choose to display them on the floating overlay, the full lyrics menu, or both.
- **Native Translation**: Uses macOS 15+ built-in neural translation to intelligently translate lyrics on the fly. Configure translations to appear on the floating overlay, the full lyrics menu, or both.
- **Manual Overrides**: If the auto-sync is slightly off or grabs the wrong song, use the menu bar to adjust the timing offset with precision `+/- 100ms` steppers, track the active line (and its exact timestamp) via the auto-scrolling Full Lyrics view, or search manually.
- **Smart Overlay Auto-Hide**: The floating lyrics widget intelligently auto-hides if the current song has no lyrics available or is an instrumental, fading out unobtrusively after 3 seconds. 
- **Plain Lyrics Auto-Scroller**: Got a song with only plain text lyrics? No problem! Toggle the auto-scroller in the menu bar and adjust the speed to smoothly scroll through plain lyrics line-by-line while you read along.
- **Kill Switch & Quick Menu**: Right-click the menu bar icon for a quick-access context menu. Need to save battery? Use the kill switch to completely disable background tracking without quitting the app.

## Requirements
- **macOS 14.0 (Sonoma)** or later.
- Native Translation feature requires **macOS 15.0 (Sequoia)** or later.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release

Since this app uses a private macOS framework (`MediaRemote`) to read what's playing without requiring complex accessibility permissions, it isn't signed for the App Store.

1. Download the latest `ezlyrics-vX.X.X.dmg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Double-click to mount the DMG, then drag `ezlyrics.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Because it's unsigned, you'll need to bypass Gatekeeper. Open your Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/ezlyrics.app
   ```
4. Open the app!

### Option 2: Build from Source
To compile the app yourself, you will need **Xcode 16** (or later) or the corresponding **Command Line Tools**. This is required because the project relies on the new `Translation` framework introduced in the macOS 15 SDK.

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RychEmrycho/ezlyrics.git
   cd ezlyrics
   ```
2. Run `make install` to compile and move the app to your `~/Applications` folder:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
